# ChatMirror
My personal alternative to Magic Mirror. Built using python to allow easier implementation of NN models in the future.

## Requirements
- espeak
- pyttsx3

## Current functions
- Current version is only able to take input from user and reply back
  - Voice is substandard, current focus of improvement

## Future functions
- Add a clock
- Add a calendar
- Add reliable LLM API (for question answering)
